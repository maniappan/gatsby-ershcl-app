The list of PoCs from which you can choose are:

### Microservices

-   The Microservice projects can be in any one of the following areas (but not limited to)
    -   Application auto-scaling instrumentation and orchestration.
    -   CQRS / ES Implementation - either using an existing framework or creating your own implementation. The two most comprehensive ones here include the Axon Framework and Lagom. Also look at SpringBoot with Akka.
        -   Reference Links : https://github.com/Romeh/spring-boot-akka-event-sourcing-starter, https://docs.axoniq.io/reference-guide/quick-start, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cISNDnwlSgw&list=WL
    -   Consumer Driven Contracts for Microservices - Leverage CDC frameworks like Spring Cloud Contract , Pact
    -   Monolith to Microservices using DDD - demonstrate this in an end to end project covering the stages of conversion using DDD concepts and principles
    -   JHipster based microservices implementation with deployment on AWS containers
    -   Microservice orchestration workflow solution based on any framework or custom solution - Zeebe , Camunda, Activiti or any other.
    
### Serverless Computing   

-   Framework of application to run on AWS Lambda and Azure Service Fabric with minimal porting.
-   Applicable for MultiCloud strategy in long term.
-   Event Driven, Stateless, Single Purpose , Asynchronous , Scale by request
-   The Serverless projects can be in any one of the following areas (but not limited to)
    -   Using a Serverless framework like Serverless , Serverless Express, AWS SAM (Automation for Provisioning) , Laconia, Claudia etc.
    -   Contact Us Forms - with notifications
    -   URL Shortner
    -   Notification System with user subscriptions and notifications
    -   GraphQL Server with subscriptions for a newsfeed
    -   AWS Lambda offline / local development and testing solution
    -   Demonstrate separation of the serverless handler vs domain logic so that we can avoid vendor lockin
    -   Create a Serverless implementation with AWS Lambda and the Serverless framework to demonstrate the pros and cons. Is it worth the overhead to use a wrapper framework like Serverless vs native AWS Lambda , just to avoid vendor lockin . Also whats the cost of migration from AWS Lambda
    -   Kubernetes Serverless framework Fission.io based Serverless usecase implementation
    -   Look at all aspects like Architecture, Security, Tools , Housekeeping , Operations, Cost
    -   Look at practical aspects - debugging, rollback, latency (code start), staging to production architecture, how to cleanup and do housekeeping.
    -   Practial Amazon Serverless principles: Amazon has no SLA for lambda. Look at aspects like event injection, how to control billing, billing alerts, security scanning, concurrency limits,  setting up security policies
    -   Serverless patterns - One lambda with dispatch, Multi lambda with shared code, Multi lambda with share nothing
        - **One Lambda with dispatch** - One lambda calling multiple backend APIs
        - **Multiple Lambda with shared code** - Copies of the sample Lambda deployed one for each API / service
        - **Multple Lambda with share nothing** - Totally separate Lambdas deployed with share nothing and one for each API / service
    -   Runtime choice is open - Node JS, Java , Kotlin , .NET etc.  
    

### Block Chain

-   Design files changes tracked and managed using Blockchain Ethereum based Smart Contract for P2P Car rental
-   The Block Chain projects can be in any one of the following areas (but not limited to)
    - **Name:** Blockchain based trusted assets exchange platform
        - **Objective :** Build a platform that enables trusted exchange of assets namely 3D printing design files between various users of these files. User who orders for manufacturing of a 3D object enters into a contract with the manufacturer and provides the specification. The manufacturer in turn hires a design engineer who models the object and provides a draft for approval. Based on the approval of the design the manufacturer generates intermediate files that will be fed into the printer for manufacturing the object. This platform ensures that the files are shared in a trustful manner between the three actors(Buyer, Designer, Manufacturer). 
        - **Justification :** The 3D design files are typically stored in .stl format. This contains the binary representation of the design of the object to be manufactured and is susceptible to changes that can be involuntary as well as malicious. To prevent this each of the file can be embedded with an unique watermark. This can be stored as an immutable block in the blockchain along with the signature of the file, timestamp, size, version of file and the actor who modified the file when it was versioned. Consumer of the file can validate the same using it further using the details available in the blockchain. 
        - **Suggested Implementation :** There are multiple blockchain implementation available, both public and enterprise private permissioned implementations. One such Enterprise grade private permissioned implementation is BigchainDB that is planned to be used for this implementation. This uses MongoDB store internally to persist the blocks and uses the Tendermint as the consensus algorithm.
        - **Rationale :** We have a customer who is interested in having this implementation as part of their medical device manufacturing workflow to ensure that the regulatory compliance of providing a trusted exchange is fulfilled. This can be extended for different types of assets(audio, video, legal PDF documents etc. ). 
     
### GPU Computing

-   Using GPU in number crunching algorithm/activities using standard programming frameworks
-   Ability to identify the GPU offloads in any given problem, model the solution and develop code to run the solution on the GPU infrastructure (single chip or a large cluster)
-   Find shortest path for a delivery route using low level CUDA programming with adjacent matrices.
-   There are high level frameworks (GraphQL) and Cloud APIs, but the idea is to develop capability in GPU

### Programming using CUDA

-   Develop capability in developing / migrating solutions to native GPU databases (example BlazingSQL, Kinetica, Sqream )

### ML/DL

-   Build Component using Weibull Analysis for estimating Remaining Useful Life of an asset.
-   Creating reusable solution from a TKT auto assignation system end to end pipeline for deploying a ML/DL model including model scores etc
-   The ML/DL projects can be in any one of the following areas (but not limited to)
    -   End to end pipeline for deploying a ML/DL model in production including model scores.
        -   **Objectives**
            -   Develop AIOps capability and use cases.
                1)	Data Preparation and Model Training
                2)	ML/DL models when deployed in production often decay over time how to maintain quality of model
                3)	Implement optimized I/O pipeline of ML/DL
                4)	Develop seamless REST API on top of model which would not be affected when the live model is changed in Realtime.
                5)	The system should be horizontally scalable and would not slow down inference rate when the load increases. 
                6)	Monitor predictions 
                7)	Secure model
        -   **Justification** 
            -   AI is about 10% modelling and 90% engineering. Not every AI concept result in a successful product, nor every model deployed in production is successful too. A pipeline helps in experimentation and in seamless deployment of a model with greater ROI.
        -   **Suggested Implementation** 
            -   Need to break down the components into parts. TFX is a very good start https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx we need to extend from here as required. 
        -   **Rationale** 
            -   Customers are already asking us these questions. We can offer to enhance their existing Big Data platform with this implementation. The nuances of deployment of ML/DL models in production needs to be understood and this would give us this opportunity. Given the heterogenous environments where the models are deployed cloud/edge/on-premise it’s important we get a complete understanding of the complexities involved. 
            -   Ref : https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/ 
    -   Develop a speech-based application to explore data, create reports and charts etc.
        -   **Objectives**  
            -   Develop an Augmented Analytics Application which would respond to speech commands and 
                -	search /explore data
                -	create reports/charts
                -	develop insights 
                -	learn 
        -   **Justification** 
            -   Mozilla Deep Learning is one the most advanced and easy to use speech recognition library. We can integrate this with simple python APIs to build a knowledgebase using Neo4j etc. MYSQL code constructs can be generated using rule-based approach using the knowledge base etc.        Metadata about the data can be mined into the knowledgebase using tools like https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/#_load_jdbc 
        -   **Suggested Implementation** 
            <Image imageName="ml-dl-speech-app" bypassImage/>
        -   **Rationale** 
            -   Augmented Analytics Is the Future of Data and Analytics. Augmented analytics, an approach that automates insights using machine learning and natural-language generation, marks the next wave of disruption in the data and analytics market.

### Voice Apps

-   To enable Voice as another channel for any use cases using native frameworks / cloud / existing assistant integration (like Alexa)
-   Develop a Quiz framework where one can upload a set of Questions / Answer choices / Right answer in JSON format and framework automatically depoys the Quiz for consumption on a Voice assistant platform (example Alexa)
-   Develop a speech based application to explore data, create reports and charts etc.

### Full Stack Node JS (with Microfrontends)          

-   Node JS microservice solution using [Nest JS](https://nestjs.com/) , [NxplorerJS](https://github.com/ERS-HCL/nxplorerjs-microservice-starter) or any other as the core Node JS framework. 
-   This should be implemented as a micro-frontend solution. 
-   Atleast 2 (nodeJS) microservices that have their own micro front end that are either linked or use custom Events.
-   Which means this is a full stack implementation – from UI to backend. 
-   The frontend could be using an App shell (that connects the two micro-front ends) or a UI micro-apps are connected via http links for transition.
-   You can explore existing microfrontend solutions like [mosaic](https://www.mosaic9.org/) , [SAP - luigi](https://github.com/SAP/luigi), [SingleSPA](https://single-spa.js.org/), [React microfrontends](https://github.com/unsafecode/react-microfrontends-demo) or any other framework.
-   The UI technology for the micro-frontend can be any of the following but not limited to - React, Vue , Angular.

### React - Design System

-   A show case project that uses Atomic Library components and ready to use page templates built using this library
-   This should be implemented as a separate component library that is leveraged in a demoable React application
-   Technology for the UI framework can CSS or CSS in JS based.
-   The technology choices and architecture should cater to the overall UI performance aspects.
-   The demoable React application could be either client side or server side rendered
-   The design system should have a demoable style guide using tools like Storybook , Styleguidist, docz
-   The projects comply with ES6 coding standards
-   As a starting point the [react-atomic-lib](https://github.com/ERS-HCL/react-atomic-lib) could be used as a reference. You can fork the project if you want to use this project as a starting point. Otherwise you are free to create your own implementation of use any other framework.
-   The language choices open - JavaScript or Typescript based implementations
